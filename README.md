## Touhou Cloud DB

Touhou Cloud DB is a collaborative platform for tagging and organizing doujin music. Our goal is to build an open-access
database that provides comprehensive information on hundreds of thousands of tracks.
It should also offer a user-friendly, visually appealing front-end interface for users to search, browse, and edit
information about music with ease.

## Contribute to Touhou Cloud Music

Our project team consists of two main groups: skilled programmers who have limited availability, and passionate doujin
music fans who have time but may lack technical skills. As our developers contribute when they can, many music
enthusiasts have taken the initiative to learn programming and are building the prototype from scratch. Progress is
steady, and our commitment to this project remains strong.

If you have expertise in front-end development, UI design, or database management—and the time to contribute—we would
love your help to bring this project closer to completion. Together, we can make Touhou Cloud DB an invaluable resource for the doujin music community!
